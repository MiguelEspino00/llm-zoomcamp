1. **Installing wget:**
   - Use **Chocolatey:** `choco install wget` 
   - **Download binary:** Download from a source like [https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) and add its location to your system's PATH environment variable.

2. **Adding wget to your PATH:** If you downloaded the binary, make sure the directory where you saved 'wget.exe' is in your system's PATH environment variable. 
","If you get “wget is not recognized as an internal or external command”, you need to install it.
On Ubuntu, run
sudo apt-get install wget
On Windows, the easiest way to install wget is to use Chocolatey:
choco install wget
Or you can download a binary from here and put it to any location in your PATH (e.g. C:/tools/)
On Mac, the easiest way to install wget is to use brew.
Brew install wget
Alternatively, you can use a Python wget library, but instead of simply using “wget” you’ll need eeeto use
python -m wget
You need to install it with pip first:
pip install wget
And then in your python code, for example in your jupyter notebook, use:
import wget
wget.download(""URL"")
This should download whatever is at the URL in the same directory as your code.

Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, gs, and file.
In some cases you might need to bypass https checks:

"You can filter rows based on values in a specific column using this code:

* `df[""ocean_proximity""] == ""<1H OCEAN""` and `df[""ocean_proximity""] == ""INLAND""` are the conditions you are checking for in the ""ocean_proximity"" column.
* `|` acts as an ""OR"" operator, meaning the row will be kept if it meets either condition.
* You can use `&` for ""AND"" if you need to satisfy multiple conditions.

```python
df = df[df['ocean_proximity'].isin(['<1H OCEAN', 'INLAND'])]

"The error message means the machine learning model received the text string 'Nissan' when it was expecting a number. 
","The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.
To resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.

import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
In this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.

"Mutual information score relies on calculating entropy, which is a measure of uncertainty in a variable. Continuous variables don't have a well-defined notion of entropy, making it difficult to calculate mutual information directly. 
","Solution: Mutual Information score calculates the relationship between categorical variables or discrete variables. So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1.

When we apply the fit method, this method is looking at the content of the df_train dictionaries we are passing to the DictVectorizer instance, and fit is figuring out (training) how to map the values of these dictionaries. If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.
With this context, if we apply the fit to the validation model, we are ""giving the answers"" and we are not letting the ""fit"" do its job for data that we haven't seen. By not applying the fit to the validation model we can know how well it was trained.

Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop.

Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop

"It's more efficient to create the `KFold` object outside the loop because it only needs to be created once. The `KFold` object itself stores the parameters for splitting the data (like `n_splits`, `shuffle`, and `random_state`). The actual splitting happens in the loop when you call `kFold.split(df_full_train)`. Creating the object repeatedly inside the loop is redundant and doesn't change the outcome.

They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in.

"Bagging, from ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" uses multiple samples with replacement to create multiple training datasets from the original training dataset. A classifier is trained on each of these datasets, and the predictions are combined (through voting for classification or averaging for regression) to get the final prediction. Boosting, conversely, trains models sequentially, with each model learning from the errors of the previous one. It assigns different weights to observations, giving higher weight to those misclassified by the previous model. This process continues until a stopping condition is met. 
","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

"If you can't install `tflite_runtime`, you can try these alternatives:

* **Use a compatible Python version:** `tflite_runtime` only supports specific Python versions. Check the available combinations and switch to a compatible version.
* **Try pre-built wheels:** The course provides pre-built wheels for different setups. You can try installing the appropriate wheel using `pip`.
* **Use TensorFlow locally and Docker for testing:** If nothing else works, use the TFLite included in TensorFlow for local development and Docker for testing Lambda functions. 
","Problem: When trying to install tflite_runtime with
!pip install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime
one gets an error message above.
Solution:
fflite_runtime is only available for the os-python version combinations that can be found here: https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/
your combination must be missing here
you can see if any of these work for you https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite
and install the needed one using pip
eg
pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl

To resolve the ""Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"" error in WSL:

1. **Check Docker Desktop's WSL Integration:** Go to Docker Desktop settings, click on ""Resources"", then ""WSL Integration"". 
2. **Enable Additional Distros:**  Make sure the checkbox for your WSL distribution is enabled. It's advised to enable this even if it's the default WSL distro. 
","Due to the uncertainties associated with machines, sometimes you can get the error message like this when you try to run a docker command:
”Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?”
Solution: The solution is simple. The Docker Desktop might no longer be connecting to the WSL Linux distro. What you need to do is go to your Docker Desktop setting and then click on resources. Under resources, click on WSL Integration. You will get a tab like the image below:

docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm \
-p 8500:8500 \
-v $(pwd)/clothing-model:/models/clothing-model/1 \

The link provided for example (2023/Capstone link ): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgoepohpgbM4MWTAHWuXa6r3NXKnxKcg4NDOm0bElAdXdnnA/viewform contains a list of all submitted projects to be evaluated. More specific, you are to review 3 assigned peer projects. In the spreadsheet are 3 hash values of your assigned peer projects. However, you need to derive the your hash value of your email address and find the value on the spreadsheet under the (reviewer_hash) heading.
To calculate your hash value run the python code below:
from hashlib import sha1
def compute_hash(email):
return sha1(email.lower().encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
# Example usage **** enter your email below (Example1@gmail.com)****
email = ""Example1@gmail.com""
hashed_email = compute_hash(email)
print(""Original Email:"", email)
print(""Hashed Email (SHA-1):"", hashed_email)
Edit the above code to replace Example1@gmail.com as your email address
Store and run the above python code from your terminal. See below as the Hashed Email (SHA-1) value

","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.
When using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.
Solution:
Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)
Note: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).

"Setting `DictVectorizer` or `OHE` to sparse during training and storing it in the BentoML model might be the cause. This leads to inconsistent sparse matrix sizes during inference, which can't be batched. 
","You might see a long error message with something about sparse matrices, and in the swagger UI, you get a code 500 error with “” (empty string) as output.
Potential reason: Setting DictVectorizer or OHE to sparse while training, and then storing this in a pipeline or custom object in the benotml model saving stage in train.py. This means that when the custom object is called in service.py, it will convert each input to a different sized sparse matrix, and this can't be batched due to inconsistent length. In this case, bentoml model signatures should have batchable set to False for production during saving the bentoml mode in train.py.

"When using DictVectorizer or One-Hot Encoding (OHE) with the sparse matrix option enabled during training, the resulting sparse matrices might have varying sizes in a BentoML production environment. This happens because each input could be converted into a sparse matrix of a different size, making batching impossible due to inconsistent lengths. To resolve this, set the 'batchable' parameter to 'False' in the BentoML model signatures during the model saving step in your 'train.py' script.

","You can consider several different approaches:
Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
