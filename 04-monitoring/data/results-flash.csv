"The error message ""could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” means that the machine learning model is expecting a numerical value but received a string instead. In this case, the model is trying to convert the car brand ""Nissan"" into a numerical value, which is not possible. 
","The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead. In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.
To resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.
Here’s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:
import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
In this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.). Each row in the DataFrame has a 1 in the column that corresponds to its brand and 0 in all other brand columns.

When we apply the fit method, this method is looking at the content of the df_train dictionaries we are passing to the DictVectorizer instance, and fit is figuring out (training) how to map the values of these dictionaries. If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.

If categorical, applies one-hot encoding, if numerical it will leave it as it is.
With this context, if we apply the fit to the validation model, we are ""giving the answers"" and we are not letting the ""fit"" do its job for data that we haven't seen. By not applying the fit to the validation model we can know how well it was trained.

"The recommended method to prevent convergence issues in Ridge regression during Week 3 is to normalize numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler. This ensures that numerical features are on a similar scale, preventing convergence issues. 
","When encountering convergence errors during the training of a Ridge regression model, consider the following steps:
Feature Normalization: Normalize your numerical features using techniques like MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler. This ensures that numerical features are on a 	similar scale, preventing convergence issues.
Categorical Feature Encoding: If your dataset includes categorical features, apply 	categorical encoding techniques such as OneHotEncoder (OHE) to 	convert them into a numerical format. OHE is commonly used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors, making them compatible with regression models like Ridge.
Combine Features: After 	normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical features using OneHotEncoder, combine them to form a single feature matrix (X_train). This combined dataset serves as the input for training the Ridge regression model.
By following these steps, you can address convergence errors and enhance the stability of your Ridge model training process. It's important to note that the choice of encoding method, such as OneHotEncoder, is appropriate for handling categorical features in this context.

"It is recommended to use DictVectorizer or get_dummies after splitting the data to avoid data leakage. Data leakage occurs when information from the test set influences the training stage, which can lead to an overly optimistic evaluation of the model's performance.

"The error message ""ValueError: This solver needs samples of at least 2 classes in the data, but the data contains only one class: 0"" indicates that your data only contains one class, which is 0. This is likely because you are using a classification model that requires at least two classes to function properly. 

The error message suggests that you have a column named ""churn"" and that you are converting it to an integer using the following code:

```python
df.churn = (df.churn == 'yes').astype(int)
```

This code will convert all ""yes"" values in the ""churn"" column to 1 and all other values to 0. If your ""churn"" column only contains ""yes"" values, then this code will result in a column with only 0s, which is why you are getting the error.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that your data contains at least two classes. You can do this by:

* **Checking your data:** Make sure that your ""churn"" column contains both ""yes"" and ""no"" values.
* **Modifying your code:** If your ""churn"" column only contains ""yes"" values, you can modify your code to convert ""yes"" to 1 and ""no"" to 0.
* **Using a different model:** If your data only contains one class, you may need to use a different model that is designed for single-class data.

"The KFold function in scikit-learn is used to split a dataset into k folds for cross-validation. The parameters `n_splits`, `shuffle`, and `random_state` control how the data is split.

* `n_splits`: This parameter specifies the number of folds to create. For example, `n_splits=5` will create 5 folds.
* `shuffle`: This parameter determines whether the data should be shuffled before splitting. If `shuffle=True`, the data will be shuffled randomly. If `shuffle=False`, the data will be split in the order it is provided.
* `random_state`: This parameter is used to control the randomness of the shuffling process. Setting a specific value for `random_state` ensures that the same shuffling will be applied every time the code is run, making the results reproducible. 

In summary, the KFold function generates a generator object that contains information about how to split the data into k folds. The actual splitting happens in a subsequent loop. The `n_splits`, `shuffle`, and `random_state` parameters control the splitting process, ensuring that the data is divided into folds in a consistent and reproducible manner.

"The video suggests looping through different C values because it allows for evaluating the model's performance with various levels of regularization. This helps determine the optimal C value that balances model complexity and generalization ability. By iterating through different C values, you can assess how the model's performance changes with varying levels of regularization, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the model's behavior and the selection of the most suitable C value for the specific task.

KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
If I do it inside the loop [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10] or outside the loop in Q6, HW04 it doesn't make any difference to my answers. I am wondering why and what is the right way, although it doesn't make a difference!
Did you try using a different random_state? From my understanding, KFold just makes N (which is equal to n_splits) separate pairs of datasets (train+val).
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html
In my case changing random state changed results
(Arthur Minakhmetov)
Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop

","While weeks 1-4 can relatively easily be followed and the associated homework completed with just about any default environment / local setup, week 5 introduces several layers of abstraction and dependencies.
It is advised to prepare your “homework environment” with a cloud provider of your choice. A thorough step-by-step guide for doing so for an AWS EC2 instance is provided in an introductory video taken from the MLOPS course here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXSiYkP23zo
Note that (only) small AWS instances can be run for free, and that larger ones will be billed hourly based on usage (but can and should be stopped when not in use).

"The CONTEXT provides information about installing WSL on Windows 10 and 11. To ensure the 'Virtual Machine Platform' feature is activated, you need to search for ""features"" in the Windows search bar and check if the checkbox is selected. 
","It is quite simple, and you can follow these instructions here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlgUDKKK5A&ab_channel=NeuralNine
Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.
In the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it
Once it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.
You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.
You can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo ""cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path"" >> ~/.bashrc
You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).
You will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip

Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.

You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.
You can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo ""cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path"" >> ~/.bashrc
You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).

"The correct command to install sklearn version 1.3.1 for homework is ""pipenv install scikit-learn==1.3.1"". 
","When the facilitator was adding sklearn to the virtual environment in the lectures, he used sklearn==0.24.1 and it ran smoothly. But while doing the homework and you are asked to use the 1.0.2 version of sklearn, it gives errors.

"The `--rm` flag removes the docker container upon exit. This is a good practice because it prevents the accumulation of stopped containers, which can take up space on your system. 
","What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?
For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.
They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.

"The error ""failed to compute cache key: ""/model2.bin"" not found"" during deployment suggests that the model file ""model2.bin"" is missing. 

The provided context suggests that you might have copied the original model file ""model1.bin"" and renamed it to ""model2.bin"". However, it seems that the renaming process did not work correctly, and the file is still missing. 

To resolve this, you can try the following:

1. **Verify the file name:** Double-check that the file is correctly named ""model2.bin"" and that it exists in the correct location.
2. **Copy the file again:** Try copying the file again, ensuring that the destination path is correct.
3. **Use the wildcard character:** As suggested in the context, you can use the command `COPY [""*"", ""./""]` to copy all files from the original Docker image and your working directory. This might resolve the issue if the file is present in your working directory.

Remember to adapt the solutions to your specific situation and environment.

"To test HTTP POST requests from the command line using curl, you can use the following command:

```
curl --json '<json data>' <url>
```

This command sends a JSON payload to the specified URL. You can also pipe the JSON data to the command using the following syntax:

```
cat <json file path> | curl --json @- <url>

This command reads the JSON data from the specified file and sends it to the URL.

You can also use the `echo` command to create a JSON string and pipe it to the command:

```
echo '<json data>' | curl --json @- <url>
```

For example, to send a JSON payload to the URL `http://localhost:9696/predict`, you can use the following command:

```

"Bagging, which stands for ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" involves creating multiple training datasets from the original dataset by taking samples with replacement. These datasets are then used to train multiple classifiers, such as decision trees or stumps. The predictions from these classifiers are then combined, using voting for classification and averaging for regression, to obtain the final prediction. Bagging is done in parallel because the classifiers are independent. It reduces variance but not bias and is robust against overfitting.

Boosting, on the other hand, is a sequential process where each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights, with misclassified observations receiving higher weights. This process continues until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a maximum number of models or achieving an acceptable error rate. Boosting reduces bias and is generally more accurate than bagging, but it can be prone to overfitting. 
","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max.

"To capture stdout output for each iteration of a loop separately, you can use the `capture_output` function from the `IPython.utils.capture` module. This function captures the output of `sys.stdout` within a context manager. You can then store the captured output in a dictionary, with the loop iteration as the key.

Therefore when the model is reloaded, it will complain about not knowing the number of channels. See the code below, in the first line, you need to specify number of channels explicitly:
# model architecture:
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_size, input_size, 3))
base = base_model(inputs, training=False)
vectors = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base)
inner = keras.layers.Dense(size_inner, activation='relu')(vectors)
drop = keras.layers.Dropout(droprate)(inner)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10)(drop)
model = keras.Model(inputs, outputs)

* input_channels: the number of channels in the input image.
* number_of_filters: the number of filters in the Conv2d layer.
* +1: for the bias term. 
","Let’s say we define our Conv2d layer like this:
>> tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3))
It means our input image is RGB (3 channels, 150 by 150 pixels), kernel is 3x3 and number of filters (layer’s width) is 32.

"The error ""Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable"" occurs when your model returns numpy float32 values, which are not directly serializable as JSON. This issue can arise when testing your lambda function locally, but not when running it on a Docker instance. The solution is to convert the numpy float32 values to base-Python floats before returning them. 
","Problem:
While passing local testing of the lambda function without issues, trying to test the same input with a running docker instance results in an error message like
{‘errorMessage’: ‘Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable’, ‘errorType’: ‘Runtime.MarshalError’, ‘requestId’: ‘f155492c-9af2-4d04-b5a4-639548b7c7ac’, ‘stackTrace’: []}
This happens when a model (in this case the dino vs dragon model) returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). They need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”.
Solution:
In my particular case, I set up the dino vs dragon model in such a way as to return a label + predicted probability for each class as follows (below is a two-line extract of function predict() in the lambda_function.py):
preds = [interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0], \
1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]]
In which case the above described solution will look like this:
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), \
float(1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]

"The dino vs dragon model returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). These need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”. 
To fix this, you need to convert the numpy float32 values to base-Python floats. You can do this by using the `float()` function. For example, if you have a numpy float32 value called `pred`, you can convert it to a base-Python float by using the following code:
```python
pred = float(pred)
```
This will convert the numpy float32 value to a base-Python float, which is JSON serializable. 
","Problem:
While passing local testing of the lambda function without issues, trying to test the same input with a running docker instance results in an error message like
{‘errorMessage’: ‘Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable’, ‘errorType’: ‘Runtime.MarshalError’, ‘requestId’: ‘f155492c-9af2-4d04-b5a4-639548b7c7ac’, ‘stackTrace’: []}
This happens when a model (in this case the dino vs dragon model) returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). They need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”.
Solution:
In my particular case, I set up the dino vs dragon model in such a way as to return a label + predicted probability for each class as follows (below is a two-line extract of function predict() in the lambda_function.py):
preds = [interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0], \
1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]]
In which case the above described solution will look like this:
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), \
float(1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]

"To test AWS Lambda with Docker locally, you need to use AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator).  You should build your Docker image using the base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10).  Then, run the image as a container using the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
```

This will start an endpoint locally at:

```
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations
```

You can then post an event to this endpoint using a curl command:

```
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'
``` 
","This deployment setup can be tested locally using AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator).
Basically, if your Docker image was built upon base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10) - just use certain ports for “docker run” and a certain “localhost link” for testing:
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
This command runs the image as a container and starts up an endpoint locally at:
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations
Post an event to the following endpoint using a curl command:
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'
Examples of curl testing:
* windows testing:

","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.

When using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.

"The issue is that your custom column transformer class is defined in the `__main__` module, which is the top-level code. When you use waitress, it loads the `predict_app` module and tries to find the class in the `__main__` module, which doesn't exist. This is because waitress loads the module separately from the `__main__` module.

When you use Flask directly, the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved, so it works.

The solution is to put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model and the script that loads the model. This ensures that the class is available in the correct namespace when the model is loaded.

"It's not always best to train a model only on the most important features.  You should include any feature that can offer additional predictive value.  You can test this by training the model with and without the feature and seeing if excluding it drops performance.  If it does, keep the feature.  If not, drop it.  Some features might be highly correlated with others, so dropping some might be fine.  There are many feature selection algorithms that can help you decide which features to include.  L1 regularization (Lasso) is one method that implicitly does feature selection by shrinking some weights all the way to zero. 
","I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it).

","You can consider several different approaches:
Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
Using Dask, an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas.
