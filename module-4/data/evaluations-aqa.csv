It also includes a reference to the original documentation link, making it closely aligned with the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly identifies the way of splitting data as a main reason for different accuracy values, which directly aligns with the original answer's focus on data splitting methods and their impact on the datasets and accuracy outcomes. The essence of the reasoning and the context are well-maintained, making the response relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about losing the REMOTE_URI variable after the session ends and provides a solution by instructing the user on how to set the variable again, which aligns well with the information in the original answer."
RELEVANT,The generated answer directly addresses the generated question and effectively provides the same information as the original answer regarding the location of the script for the Kitchenware Classification Competition dataset. It restates the core details and is contextually aligned with the original answer.
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the solution for the TensorFlow Serving error on an Apple M1 Mac, accurately detailing the necessary commands to pull and run the alternative Docker image. It closely follows the structure and information provided in the original answer, ensuring that all critical details are included."
NON_RELEVANT,The generated answer addresses a different error related to protobuf and installation issues rather than the NotSupportedError concerning the Docker platform mentioned in the original answer. The steps provided do not resolve the issue raised in the original question about using 'eb local' with Docker platforms.
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly identifies Tzvi Friedman as the person who added the solution, but it does not address the original context of the error or the solution itself regarding the use of the correct datasets in Keras model training. Thus, it is somewhat relevant but lacks direct relevance to the specifics of the problem presented in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reflects the information provided in the original answer. It clearly states the first step, which is to launch a PowerShell terminal with administrator privileges, and includes the necessary command to install the Choco library, matching the original answer's content and intent."
RELEVANT,The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a complete code snippet that demonstrates how to fetch data for homework using the `requests` library. It accurately replicates the content and format of the original answer while maintaining the same context and functionality.
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question of whether `mean_squared_error` can be used to compute RMSE in one step. It confirms this by explaining how to set the `squared` parameter to `False`, thus aligning closely with the original answer's guidance on extracting the RMSE value using `mean_squared_error`, reinforcing the correctness and relevance of the information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the generated question by providing the exact links to the documentation about how Lambda functions are initialized, which aligns with the information in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question of how to read data from a GitHub URL using pandas, providing an accurate explanation and code snippet that matches the content of the original answer.
